- [√] support passing id, click handlers, etc, spreading intrinsic element props
- [√] allow passing in different element types, if they want it to be `<section>`, etc...
- [√] consider allowing passing a prop to customize min-size, for vertical-ish images,

- [ ] try preloading `eager` images

- [ ] independent position/size for different layers
- [ ] ci
- [ ] make filter transition better for debluring
- [ ] look into intersection observer firing twice (with console.log)
- [ ] throw away smaller sizes when threshold is hit if lazy, not on page load
- [ ] docs/demo site
- [ ] look into pixel-density/retina screen stuff
- [ ] look into image-set

- [ ] support passing id, click handlers, etc, spreading intrinsic element props
- [ ] allow passing in different element types, if they want it to be `<section>`, etc...
- [ ] consider allowing passing a prop to customize min-size, for vertical-ish images,
      where the viewport width heuristic gives bad results, look at evans contact page for
      example
- [ ] explore base 64 data urls for blur images
- [ ] make filter transition better for debluring
- [ ] look into intersection observer firing twice (with console.log)
- [ ] throw away smaller sizes when threshold is hit if lazy, not on page load
